# ðŸ”¥ Full Stack Development Internship Project â€“ Cognifyz Technologies

Welcome to my Full Stack Web Development project built as part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. This project includes **8 progressively advanced tasks**, each focusing on a critical aspect of full stack development â€” from HTML structure and basic form handling to API integration, authentication, external services, caching, and more.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a full-featured web application that demonstrates the following:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB, JSON (simulated DB), Redis (for caching)
- Tools: Postman, Google OAuth, GeoAPI

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction**
- Built a static form
- Setup Express server with EJS templating
- Rendered pages dynamically using server-side rendering

### 2. **Form Styling, Validation, and Server Handling**
- Used inline CSS & JS for basic styling and validation
- Implemented form validation on both client and server sides

### 3. **Advanced CSS & Responsive Design**
- Designed multi-section responsive layout using **Bootstrap** and **TailwindCSS**
- Added animations and transitions for improved UX

### 4. **Complex Form Validation & DOM Manipulation**
- Password strength checker
- Dynamic form behavior with vanilla JS
- Simulated client-side routing

### 5. **API Integration and Front-End Interaction**
- Created custom RESTful API with CRUD operations
- Interacted with API using Fetch
- Dynamically displayed server data on the frontend

### 6. **Database Integration and User Authentication**
- User registration and login logic
- Stored user data in JSON file (simulated DB)
- Tested endpoints using **Postman**

### 7. **External API Integration & Rate Limiting**
- Integrated **GeoAPI** to fetch user location
- Used **Google OAuth** for authentication
- Applied **rate limiting** to secure APIs (100 req/min)

### 8. **Advanced Server-Side Functionality**
- Created middleware for request logging and parsing
- Implemented **Redis caching** to improve performance
- Explored task queues for future learning
